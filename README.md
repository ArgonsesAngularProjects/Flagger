## Flagger

Flagger is a front-end project where you can challenge your knowledge of flags. There are five modes: easy, medium, hard, expert and extreme. Each mode has a different number of flags to guess, a time limit and a scoring system. 

## Installation

To install Flagger, you need to have [Node.js] and [Angular CLI] installed on your system. 
Then, clone this repository and run the following commands in the project directory:

- npm install
- ng serve

This will start a development server on http://localhost:4200/. You can open this URL in your browser to see the application.

## Usage

To play Flagger, you need to select a mode from the main menu. Then, you will see a flag on the screen and four possible options to choose from. You need to click on the correct option before the time runs out. If you answer correctly, you will get points and move on to the next flag. If you answer incorrectly or run out of time, you will be moved to another question but you loose one point.
You will see your total score.
